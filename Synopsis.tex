	\color[HTML]{1a76bd}\subsection*{Objectives}
	\paragraph{} \color{black} Cauchy distribution has an important impact on the Statistical society, specially in the Estimation Theory. The distribution with density $ \frac{1}{\pi(1+x^2)} $ has some peculiar properties which was first observed by Simeon Denis Poisson. This leads to counter examples to some well known and widely accepted results and theories in Statistics. 
	\paragraph{} The Cauchy distribution has also some unique features for which this always seeks a special attention of the Statisticians and make them indulge in rigorous studies of its characteristics. `Apart from the Normal distribution why Cauchy distribution is needed' - to study this, is another aspect of this project. 
	
	\color[HTML]{1a76bd}\subsection*{Methodology}
	\paragraph{} \color{black} To study the above mentioned topics, we focus on two broad sections - 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Difference between Normal and Cauchy population \\ [5pt] $-$ Here, we will run a simulation program to observe the behaviour of the tests under the normality assumptions and sample from a Cauchy population
		\item Cauchy Distribution in Estimation Theory \\ [5pt] $-$ Here, we will check the consistency, Maximum Likelihood Estimation and the concepts of Cramer-Rao Inequality under the Cauchy setup.
	\end{itemize}
