# Importance-of-Cauchy-Distribution
Short discussion on the Cauchy Distribution: A Dissertation Project Work at 3rd Year of my Statistics undergraduate program

This project is about the Cauchy distribution, a very well known probability distribution in Statistics. Here, some important and interesting properties of Cauchy distribution are discussed. Comparison of Cauchy with the Normal has been done and verified the results using simulations. Also, the impact of Cauchy in statistical inference has been discussed.
